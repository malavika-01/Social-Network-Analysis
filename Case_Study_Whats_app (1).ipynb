This means that all the classes should take the exam in AUMS at the same time, through a common link. So please discuss amongst yourselves and give us a 2-hour slot when all of you are free. It can even be 4 to 6 p.m. The 2 hour exam will consist of 50 Verbal questions & 50 Aptitude questions (multiple choice).\n",

All you have to do is write 3 assignments of 2000 words each to score 70 internal marks. Yet, I am a bit disappointed to see that some students are blindly copy pasting from online sources. Turnitin is showing up plagiarism % of 80 and more for some assignments even though we had mentioned clearly that anything more than 10% is unacceptable in the academic world. At least for the third assignment which is due tomorrow night, please put some basic effort and write it in your own words instead of borrowing from online sources since P3 has a higher weightage of 30 marks. Please keep in mind that if you use sentences similar to those on the net or insert too many quotes, it will show up as increase in plagiarism %.\n",

Henceforth, if we are going to back out of a particular issue because the teacher does not understand us, please let’s bring up the issue in the first place.

Even after asking to her multiple times she was fixed with her method of mark allocation. Our issue is not with hpoj our only problem is our marks will be affected when time is included.\n",

So let me make a suggestion, we'll tell ma'am that we are ok with the hpoj mode since,she has already told nayana that even though its hpoj mode,she'll be looking into code manually also. With that hope,we'll tell option 1. Another thing is that we can ask her to publish the marks, so we'll really understand how the evaluation had gone. If she doesn't publish the mark,lets see.\n",

            "Words help people communicate with each other about something trivial such as their needs and wants,express their opinions on a topic without any discrimination with respect to their caste or creed and also express how they feel to one another. Right from the sound that we made as a baby to the words we are speaking now words are nothing but vibrations… these vibrations then help us form the reality surrounding us and also help us put our thoughts in a way that a stranger will be able to get it. These vibrations..if positive can nudge a person forward to achieve great things in life……but in  the negative direction can shake up a person and totally throw him/her of their path…in other words the words that come out of a person’s mouth contains the power either to fuel one’s confidence and ambition or to make one feel anxious and inadequate……\n",

In contrast to this people are unaware of the effect that the negative words which they perceive to be helpful can have on others…the effects include childhood trauma,anxiety,self defeating behaviour and sometimes even include people taking their own lives in the extreme cases……therefore taking the negative words out of your conversation is very important………… along the way we can also turn the world into a beautiful place by making people comfortable and happy instead of making them feel anxious and threatened…\n",

            "Sentence A, above, says “I spoke to someone.” The sentence later says, “they told me,” and based on context it is clear that the “they” in question is the “someone at the help desk.”  “Someone” is singular. You may have learned that “they” and “their” are plural pronouns and should not be used to indicate gender neutrality. However, language evolves, and there is a growing acceptance of their use as singular pronouns; indeed, there is even evidence to suggest that “they” may have been used as a singular pronoun as far back as the 14th century. In recognition of these evolving standards, the GMAT test-makers have stated that they will not test the issue of whether “they” and “their” can refer to a single person. So, you will never see a sentence like Sentence A on the GMAT and have to fix this so-called error.\n",

            "As per the present schedule its given tt 1- 37 and nt 37- 1 on sat itself. But, there is possibility of pending and also tough to prepare for both vivas the same day. Instead, can we split like : TT 1 - 18 on sat,and NT 37-19 . Then on 5th, TT 19-37 and NT 18 - 1. So each person has to prepare for only 1 viva a day and each day we can finish it by noon or latest by eve. So that even if we have internals test of rp on 6th,we'll get time to study. Is this ok for all? I just got this idea in mind. If not,we'll go with the old one.\n",

They told that the students of our class are not much focused on internships and various other opportunities. We have nk acquaintance with the faculties. They have never seen the students of our class in the dept to meet faculties and get to know them or ask them for guidance regarding any projects or internships. Our senior batch was never like this. Since,they were the first batch,there were a lot of constraints,but still they worked hard. They had contacts with the dept. So some of them who didn't get any internship,did projects and 2 of them even did an internship under the MBA dept for Business Analytics. He said that,we have to work beyond our subject. Beyond the coursewise knowledge, we have to work on various projects,internships in firms or even freelance during our freetime. He tells that we aren't serious and just playing and that ita high time we have a clear idea about how to go about. He also asked,why none of the students from our class didnt do an internship. So we said that many of us had done,and that we had filled in the gform as told by Murali sir. But the fact is,Murali Sir hasn't passed on that information to the dept or HOD. So he asked me to get the list. Becoz,they have a record of students who have done the internship. So al those who did and are planning to do,pls do update the form. I will be sharing it with the HOD by today afternoon.\n",

Sir told he will give 15 topics so each group can choose one from it or select any topic on the same level as the one he suggested. We have to write a paper based on the topic chosen. He said that the marks for the group assignment will be based on completion of the work on time, communication and document submission. If these 3 are done properly he will give full marks. Sir will send the template for the document. Also sir said that the 'strength of the chain is the weakest link of the chain' so whoever gets the lowest mark amongst the three will be the entire mark of the group, so contributions should be even.\n",

If you get the internship through CIR, then also comunicate with the CIR and ensure it starts only in Septemeber.\n",

            "\n",
            "=> These internships will be validated by the college based on the credibility of the organization, the purpose of the role (whether it aligns with the stream we are in), and the project(s) that we are involved in - doing something for the sake of it will not be accepted\n",
            "\n",
            "3. Internships can be converted to final year projects only if the company allows you to use the data and only if is substantial. Else, the project has to be independent of the internship.\n",
            "\n",

At the same time, pushing the fastrack further could be detrimental to our internships. Hence, it'd be ideal if the fast track can start on the 5th or the 6th of July [but not later than that], instead of the 3rd.
